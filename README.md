# darkSky

The darkSky repository allows users to easily determine the times when the sky is the darkest (i.e. the times during astronomical twilight when the moon is below the horizon for a desired location and date range).

## Description

The darkSky repository allows users to effortlessly determine the optimal moments of darkness during the night sky. By inputting a desired date range, latitude/longitude coordinates and timezone, this project calculates the times when there is no observable moon in the sky and the center of the sun is 18 degrees or more below the horizon. The primary objective of darkSky is to facilitate the identification of ideal periods when the absence of astronomical twilight and the moon's presence converge, resulting in the darkest skies imaginable.

***Soon to come***
- Ability to download a .csv file of the generated times.
- Display all info used to calculate darkSky times (astronomical twilight start/end, moon rise/set).
